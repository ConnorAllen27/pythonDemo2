# pythonDemo


This is some python code to test extracts from a cloud build from a TELUS health EMR.

This code is meant to be uploaded to the cloud along with some other cloudbuild.yml and some other supporting python files.

Omited bucket names, project names and security key names

I also included a docker file becuase the application mentioned it.


Please not that the addPatientDemographicsDetails_1.py file was mostly not written by me but I feel like this repo wasn't complete without it.
